= Models

== Software

I used the standard Silhouette software with a
[Silhouette Portrait](http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/machines/portrait)
to design, and cut the models. I hightly recommend the v2 series of the software
that can cut from edge to edge.

In reality, any cutting or CNC machine can do this, depending on how handy you are.

I started with a basic [3d tea-light model](http://www.silhouettedesignstore.com/?page=view-shape&id=69143)
as inspriation to build other ones.
